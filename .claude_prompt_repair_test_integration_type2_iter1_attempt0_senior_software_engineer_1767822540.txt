Run all integration tests for this project.

Please identify the appropriate test framework and location for integration tests.

**IMPORTANT**: When running tests, save the test results to a file in /tmp so that you can refer back to them and so they're not made part of the codebase.

These tests runs can take some time to complete, please be patient and don't put time limits on the test execution. Make sure you're capturing the information you need to identify failures without having to re-run the tests multiple times.

Also, make sure you are capturing the **full** output of the test runs, including any warnings and errors, to disk to avoid having to re-run the tests multiple times.

Be mindful of environment setup steps like installing dependencies and activating virtual environments.

CRITICAL: You MUST return ONLY valid JSON in this EXACT format (no markdown, no explanation):
{
    "passed": <number of tests that passed>,
    "failed": <number of tests that failed>,
    "warnings": <number of warnings>,
    "failures": [
        {"file": "test_file.py", "test": "test_function_name", "message": "failure message"},
        ...
    ],
    "warning_list": [
        {"file": "source_file.py", "message": "warning message"},
        ...
    ]
}

DO NOT include any explanation, markdown formatting, or other text - ONLY the JSON object.

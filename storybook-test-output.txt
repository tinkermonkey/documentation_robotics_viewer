[31m[test-storybook][0m It seems that your Storybook instance is not running at: http://localhost:61001. Are you sure it's running?

If you're not running Storybook on the default 6006 port or want to run the tests against any custom URL, you can pass the --url flag like so:

yarn test-storybook --url http://127.0.0.1:9009

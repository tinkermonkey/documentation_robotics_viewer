I implement clean, well thought out code with proper error handling and maintainable architecture.

**Issue Title**: [PR Feedback] Type Safety - Configuration Types

**Description**:
Based on consolidated PR review, address the following in **Type Safety - Configuration Types**:

- **UnifiedNodeData Weak Type Safety**: Type extends `Record<string, unknown>` which breaks encapsulation by allowing arbitrary additional properties. `/workspace/src/core/nodes/components/UnifiedNode.tsx`
- **NodeConfig Types Lose Type Safety**: `typeMap: Record<string, string>` and `nodeStyles: Record<string, NodeStyleConfig>` don't reference `NodeType`, losing compile-time safety. `/workspace/src/core/nodes/nodeConfig.types.ts`

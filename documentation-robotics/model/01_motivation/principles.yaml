  name: User-Centric Design
  category: application
  documentation: >-
    All design decisions prioritize the user experience. The interface should
    be intuitive, discoverable, and require minimal learning curve. User
    feedback directly influences feature development and UI improvements.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: >-
        Architecture visualization tools are only valuable if users can
        effectively navigate and understand the presented information.
        Complex underlying models must be presented in accessible ways.
      implications: >-
        Requires user research, iterative design, and continuous feedback.
        May require simplification of complex architectural concepts.

performance-first:
  id: motivation.principle.performance-first
  name: Performance First
  category: technology
  documentation: >-
    Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. All components must meet
    defined performance targets: initial render under 3 seconds for 500 elements,
    filter operations under 500ms, and 60fps pan/zoom interactions.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: >-
        Architecture models can contain hundreds or thousands of elements.
        Poor performance directly impacts user productivity and adoption.
        Users will not use tools that feel sluggish.
      implications: >-
        Requires performance budgets, regular benchmarking, and optimization.
        May require trade-offs between features and performance. Web Workers
        for heavy computation, viewport culling for large graphs.

accessibility-by-default:
  id: motivation.principle.accessibility-by-default
  name: Accessibility by Default
  category: application
  documentation: >-
    Accessibility is built into every component from the start, not retrofitted.
    The application must meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. All interactive elements
    must be keyboard accessible with proper focus management and ARIA labels.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: >-
        Architecture visualization must be usable by all team members regardless
        of ability. Legal requirements (ADA, Section 508) may apply. Accessible
        design often improves usability for all users.
      implications: >-
        Requires accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline. May affect visual
        design choices (color contrast, font sizes). Keyboard navigation
        must be comprehensive.

progressive-enhancement:
  id: motivation.principle.progressive-enhancement
  name: Progressive Enhancement
  category: application
  documentation: >-
    Core functionality works in basic environments with enhanced features
    for capable browsers. The application degrades gracefully when advanced
    features are unavailable. Embedded mode works with minimal JavaScript.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: >-
        The viewer must work reliably in various contexts: standalone, embedded
        in documentation sites, or integrated into other tools. Cannot assume
        all features of the latest browsers.
      implications: >-
        Requires feature detection over browser detection. Core visualization
        must work without advanced features. Enhanced features (animations,
        advanced layouts) are optional improvements.

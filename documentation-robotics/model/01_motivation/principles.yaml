  name: User-Centric Design
  type: principle
  layer: motivation
  documentation: All design decisions prioritize the user experience. The
    interface should be intuitive, discoverable, and require minimal learning
    curve. User feedback directly influences feature development and UI
    improvements.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: Architecture visualization tools are only valuable if users can
        effectively navigate and understand the presented information. Complex
        underlying models must be presented in accessible ways.
      implications: Requires user research, iterative design, and continuous feedback.
        May require simplification of complex architectural concepts.

  name: Performance First
  type: principle
  layer: motivation
  documentation: "Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. All components
    must meet defined performance targets: initial render under 3 seconds for
    500 elements, filter operations under 500ms, and 60fps pan/zoom
    interactions."
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: Architecture models can contain hundreds or thousands of elements.
        Poor performance directly impacts user productivity and adoption. Users
        will not use tools that feel sluggish.
      implications: Requires performance budgets, regular benchmarking, and
        optimization. May require trade-offs between features and performance.
        Web Workers for heavy computation, viewport culling for large graphs.

  name: Accessibility by Default
  type: principle
  layer: motivation
  documentation: Accessibility is built into every component from the start, not
    retrofitted. The application must meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. All
    interactive elements must be keyboard accessible with proper focus
    management and ARIA labels.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: Architecture visualization must be usable by all team members
        regardless of ability. Legal requirements (ADA, Section 508) may apply.
        Accessible design often improves usability for all users.
      implications: Requires accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline. May affect
        visual design choices (color contrast, font sizes). Keyboard navigation
        must be comprehensive.

  name: Progressive Enhancement
  type: principle
  layer: motivation
  documentation: Core functionality works in basic environments with enhanced
    features for capable browsers. The application degrades gracefully when
    advanced features are unavailable. Embedded mode works with minimal
    JavaScript.
  properties:
    principle:
      rationale: "The viewer must work reliably in various contexts: standalone,
        embedded in documentation sites, or integrated into other tools. Cannot
        assume all features of the latest browsers."
      implications: Requires feature detection over browser detection. Core
        visualization must work without advanced features. Enhanced features
        (animations, advanced layouts) are optional improvements.

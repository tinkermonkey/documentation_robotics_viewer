react-flow-vs-custom:
  id: motivation.assessment.react-flow-vs-custom
  name: React Flow vs Custom Visualization
  type: assessment
  documentation: Trade-off between using React Flow library versus building custom graph visualization
  properties:
    assessment:
      decision: use-react-flow
      rationale: React Flow provides mature graph rendering with accessibility, while custom solution would require significant development effort
      pros:
        - Mature library with active development
        - Built-in accessibility support
        - Extensive customization options
        - Good performance characteristics
      cons:
        - External dependency risk
        - Learning curve for team
        - Limited control over internal implementation
      alternatives-considered:
        - D3.js custom visualization
        - Canvas-based custom renderer
        - SVG-based custom solution

yaml-vs-json-schema:
  id: motivation.assessment.yaml-vs-json-schema
  name: YAML Instance vs JSON Schema Only
  type: assessment
  documentation: Trade-off between YAML instance format and pure JSON Schema approach
  properties:
    assessment:
      decision: support-both
      rationale: YAML is more human-friendly for authoring, JSON Schema provides validation, supporting both maximizes adoption
      pros:
        - YAML easier to write and read
        - Human-friendly dot-notation IDs
        - Better git diffs
      cons:
        - Parser complexity
        - Two formats to maintain
        - Potential inconsistencies

embedding-strategy:
  id: motivation.assessment.embedding-strategy
  name: Embedding Strategy
  type: assessment
  documentation: Trade-off between iframe embedding versus direct component integration
  properties:
    assessment:
      decision: iframe-with-postmessage
      rationale: Iframe provides security isolation and version independence, PostMessage enables controlled communication
      pros:
        - Security isolation
        - Version independence
        - No dependency conflicts
      cons:
        - Slightly more complex integration
        - Cross-origin communication overhead
        - Size/performance overhead

state-management:
  id: motivation.assessment.state-management
  name: State Management Approach
  type: assessment
  documentation: Trade-off between Redux, Context API, and Zustand for state management
  properties:
    assessment:
      decision: use-zustand
      rationale: Zustand provides simple, performant state management without Redux boilerplate or Context re-render issues
      pros:
        - Minimal boilerplate
        - Excellent performance
        - Easy to learn
        - TypeScript support
      cons:
        - Smaller ecosystem than Redux
        - Less middleware options
        - Newer library with smaller community

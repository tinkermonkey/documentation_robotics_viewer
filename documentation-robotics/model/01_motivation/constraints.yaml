  documentation: >-
    Application targets modern evergreen browsers only: Chrome/Edge 90+,
    Firefox 90+, Safari 14+. No support for Internet Explorer or legacy
    browsers. This enables use of modern JavaScript features and CSS.

  rationale: >-
    Modern browser features (ES2020+, CSS Grid, Web Workers) are required
    for performance targets. Supporting legacy browsers would significantly
    increase development effort and limit capabilities.

    Application must use React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety. React Flow
    (@xyflow/react) for graph visualization. Vite for build tooling. Tailwind CSS
    for styling. These choices are fixed for the current version.

  rationale: >-
    Technology choices were made based on team expertise, ecosystem maturity,
    and performance characteristics. React Flow provides the best combination
    of features and performance for graph visualization.
